# PlantDoctor

This was supposed to be a full stack project but server connection is having issues as of now so the final project as of now is present as terminal based project in Plant Doctor.ipynb.

There are two PlantDoctor.ipynb files.
One in Colab folder and other outside.
The Colab folder file has a cleaner output, otherwise no changes are present.

To run it in your device, you might need to use PlantDiseaseModel.h5 file.
Link for accessing it is https://drive.google.com/file/d/1pTaW5TxwyMjHQoKPc2xD5xFpal1e832V/view?usp=sharing as it is too big to be uploaded on git.
This is the link for colab file of working model https://colab.research.google.com/drive/14aMVuMo_yRzistPM1t2E-YOmQus76bwC?usp=sharing
